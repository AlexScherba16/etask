## General info

This project is designed to process a MongoDB JSON dump containing forex quotes for a specific currency pair (EURAUD).
The program reads the input file and computes statistical metrics over 30-minute intervals for the bid and ask prices,
as well as their respective volumes.

This project follows a MapReduce-inspired approach to efficiently process large JSON dumps of forex quotes.
The architecture consists of four main stages, each designed for parallel execution,
ensuring optimal performance in a multithreaded environment.

## Under the hood architecture

![pipeline](docs/pictures/pipeline_schema.png)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing ‚Äì Splitting the File for Parallel Processing

The input JSON file is partitioned into multiple chunks for efficient parallel processing.
Each chunk is assigned to a separate Mapper thread, ensuring load distribution across CPU cores.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping ‚Äì Parsing and Time-based Partitioning

Mappers parse JSON strings and convert them into Quote structures.
Each Quote is assigned to a 30-minute time interval, ensuring structured organization for further computation.
Quotes are pushed into concurrent queues, categorized by their respective intervals.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reducing ‚Äì Computing Statistics for Each Interval

Each Reducer thread processes quotes from its assigned interval queue.
Statistical calculations (min, max, avg, median) are performed on bid/ask prices and volumes.
The computed statistics are stored for final aggregation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation ‚Äì Collecting and Finalizing Results

The statistics from all reducers are gathered into a final output (console or file).
This step ensures that all computed interval data is consolidated for reporting.
